Helping Hand README
===================

Helping Hand is an app that was designed to do exactly what its name says, lend a helping hand. I wanted to make an app that would serve an actual purpose and be helpful in some way to others. So I thought about things that a lot of people struggle with and depression was one of the first things that came to my mind. People without depression can also use the app just to vent. Helping Hand was created so people wouldn't feel alone, so they'd feel like there was someplace they could go for a sense of release.

The Entire App:

-The name Helping Hand was chosen because that's something everybody needs one in a while. This app was created in order to lift up its users and help them with life's toughest battles.

-The logo that can be seen at the top of the page is something simple, but not too plain. The light purple color goes very well with the maroon background and the Superclarendon font makes it not look too boring. 

-The fonts used throughout the app are simple and easy to read. I chose them because I wouldn't want someone to not use my app simply because they just couldn't read it.

-I think I chose the perfect colors for my color scheme. The light purple and white compliment the warm maroon and black very well. I didn’t want something too dark or too light, it needed to be just right.

-My code is easy to read and neatly arranged.


Quotes Page:

-The quotes page is basically a home page. This is the first page a user sees whenever they launch the app. At the top of the page is the Helping Hand logo and a list of links to other pages in the app. Below the links, there is a quote that can be changed with a button located below. The quotes are there in order to hopefully give the user some encouragement. If they need to view more than one, there's plenty and they can be accessed with the click of the button. 

About Us Page:

-This page lets the user know what Helping Hand is and how exactly it can be used. 
-This page has a paragraph letting the user know about depression and how many people it affects globally.
-This page also includes a quick summary of the app and what the functions are, and where they can find these things.

Journal Page:

-The journal page is where the user can go to vent about anything that may be on their mind at the time. Once the user has completed their journaling, they can delete whatever they may have typed, this is similar to an open letter. 
-After deleting their journal entry, the user is taken to a confirmation page that lets them know their entry has been deleted.

Helpful Information:

-The helpful information page consists of a small paragraph letting the user know that they are not alone and that there are many people out there willing to help.
-This page includes numbers the user can call if they ever feel suicidal, or just need to talk.

How I Created My App:

Creating my app was a very simple process I'd like to think. First I created my Quotes Page. I designed it and figured out exactly how I wanted it to look, then I created an array that included every quote that the user could possibly get. I connected my button to the label for the quotes, made sure the quotes were different every time the button was clicked, and I went from there. I created the rest of my pages then created links that connected them all together. I added all of my buttons, text boxes, and labels and made sure that they all worked well.
